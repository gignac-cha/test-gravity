# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A TypeScript-based gravity simulation showing basketball physics with Earth's gravitational field. Features realistic physics calculations, collision detection, and interactive controls.

**🤖 AI-Generated Codebase**: This entire project was created using Claude AI through conversational programming. Every component, from physics calculations to deployment workflows, was generated through AI assistance.

## Architecture

### Core Classes
- `Vector2` (`vector2.ts`) - 2D vector mathematics
- `CelestialBody` (`celestial-body.ts`) - Physics objects with mass, position, velocity
- `PhysicsEngine` (`physics-engine.ts`) - Gravitational force calculations using F = G×m₁×m₂/r²
- `CanvasRenderer` (`canvas-renderer.ts`) - Drawing primitives with transparency and borders
- `GravitySimulation` (`gravity-simulation.ts`) - Main simulation loop and interaction handling

### Physics Implementation
- Uses actual gravitational constant: G = 6.6743015×10⁻¹¹ N⋅m²/kg²
- Earth mass: 5.972×10²⁴ kg, radius: 6.378×10⁶ m
- Basketball mass: 0.624 kg, radius: 0.1194 m (NBA official)
- Elastic collision with restitution coefficient 0.8
- Real-time physics (1:1 time scale)

### Simulation Features
- 11 basketballs at heights 5m-15m, spread horizontally ±1m each
- Mouse wheel zoom (10⁻¹⁰ to 10¹⁰ scale range)
- Mouse drag panning
- 60fps rendering with requestAnimationFrame
- Collision detection and bouncing physics

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run with Node.js (for debugging)
node script.ts
```

## Deployment

The project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Push to `main` branch triggers build and deploy
2. **Build Process**: Vite builds TypeScript and SCSS to optimized static files
3. **GitHub Pages**: Served at `https://gignac-cha.github.io/test-gravity/`
4. **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` handles CI/CD pipeline

### Manual Deployment Setup

1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. Select "GitHub Actions" as source
3. Push code to main branch
4. Check Actions tab for deployment status

## Controls

- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Mouse Drag**: Pan camera view
- **Auto**: Physics simulation runs automatically

## Physics Accuracy

The simulation uses precise real-world values and calculations:
- Actual Earth mass and radius
- Official NBA basketball specifications  
- Universal gravitational constant (CODATA 2018)
- Accurate collision mechanics with energy loss
